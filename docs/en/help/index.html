        <p>
            Muslim Day is intended to help Muslims evaluate their daily activities on the way to
            imitate the lifestyle of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) in Religion and life.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the daily assessment and the progress tracker, Muslim Day motivates you to be a
            better Muslim every day. You can always update your preferences and/or edit the list of
            daily activities to match your own personal goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Muslim Day is available in both Arabic and English Languages, and the user can switch
            between the two languages from the application settings.
