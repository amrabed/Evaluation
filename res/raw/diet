Al-Miqdad (May Allah be pleased with him)reported that the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said "No man fills a container worse than his stomach. A few morsels that keep his back upright are sufficient for him. If he has to, then he should keep one-third for food, one-third for drink and one-third for his breathing." [Tirmidhi]
