Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: My friend (the Messenger of Allah) (Peace be upon him) directed me to observe fast for three days in every month, to perform two Rak`ah (optional) Duha prayer at forenoon and to perform the Witr prayer before going to bed. [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

Ali (bin Abu Talib) (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Witr prayer is not obligatory as the prescribed Salat (prayers), but the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) observed it as his regular practice (Sunnah). He (Peace be upon him) said, "Allah is Witr (single, odd) and loves what is Witr. So perform Witr prayer. O followers of Qur'an, observe Witr (prayer)" [At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud]

Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (Peace be upon him) said, "Make Witr prayer the last of your Salat at night" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him)reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "He who apprehends that he may not get up in the later part of the night, should observe the Witr prayer in the first part of it; and he who is certain to get up in the last part of it, he should observe Witr at the end of the night, because Salat at the end of the night is attended (by the angels), and that is better" [Muslim]

Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) observed Witr prayer in every part of night at the beginning, middle and at the last part. He (Peace be upon him), however, would finish his Witr prayer before dawn. [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (Peace be upon him) said, "Perform Witr prayer before dawn" [Muslim]

Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Prophet (Peace be upon him) used to perform his voluntary prayer at night (i.e., Tahajjud prayer) while she was sleeping in front of him; and when the Witr prayer was yet to be observed, he would awaken her to perform her Witr prayer. [Muslim]

Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (Peace be upon him) said, "Hasten to perform the Witr prayer before dawn" [Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi]
