Umm Habibah (May Allah be pleased with her) the Mother of the Believers reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) saying, "A house will be built in Jannah for every Muslim who offers twelve Rak`ah of optional Salat other than the obligatory Salat in a day and a night (to seek the Pleasure of Allah)" [Muslim]. They are four before Zuhr and two after, two before Maghrib, two before Isha, and two before Fajr [Al-Tirmithi]
