Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "Taking a bath (before coming to Friday prayers) is obligatory on every adult" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

Samurah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "It suffices to perform Wudu' properly for the Friday prayer; but it is better to take a bath" [Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi]

Salman (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "If a man takes bath on Friday, (or) purifies himself as much as he can with Wudu', oils his hair, applies whatever perfume available in his house, sets forth for the mosque, does not separate two people (to make a seat for himself), performs Salat what is prescribed for him, remains silent when the Imam speaks, his (minor) sins between that Friday and the following Friday will be forgiven" [Al-Bukhari]
 
Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "He who takes a bath on Friday, like the bath for ceremonial purity, and then goes (to the mosque), he is like one who offers a camel as a sacrifice to seek the Pleasure of Allah; and he who comes at the second hour is like one who offers a cow to win the Pleasure of Allah; and he who comes at the third hour is like one who offers a ram with horns (in sacrifice); and he who comes at the fourth hour is like one who offers a hen; and he who comes at the fifth hour is like one who offers an egg. And when the Imam ascends the pulpit, the angels (who write the names of those who come to the mosque before the coming of the Imam) close (their record) in order to listen to the Khutbah" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]
