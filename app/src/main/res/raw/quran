Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) saying, "Read the Qur'an, for it will come as an intercessor for its reciters on the Day of Resurrection" [Muslim]

Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "The one who is proficient in the recitation of the Qur'an will be with the honourable and obedient scribes (angels) and he who recites the Qur'an and finds it difficult to recite, doing his best to recite it in the best way possible, will have a double reward" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "Whoever recites a letter from the Book of Allah, he will be credited with a good deed, and a good deed gets a ten-fold reward. I do not say that Alif-Lam-Mim is one letter, but Alif is a letter, Lam is a letter and Mim is a letter" [At-Tirmidhi]

Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "The believer who recites the Qur'an is like a citron whose fragrance is sweet and whose taste is delicious. A believer who does not recite the Qur'an is like a date-fruit which has no fragrance but has a sweet taste. The hypocrite who recites the Qur'an is like a colocynth whose fragrance is so sweet, but its taste is bitter. The hypocrite who does not recite the Qur'an is like basil which has no fragrance and its taste is bitter" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

Al-Bara' bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A man was reciting Surat Al-Kahf, and a horse was tied with two ropes beside him. As he was reciting, a cloud overshadowed him, and as it began to come nearer and nearer, the horse began to trample voilently. The man came to the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) in the morning and mentioned the incident to him. He (Peace be upon him) said, "That was tranquillity which descended as a result of the recitation of the Qur'an.''
