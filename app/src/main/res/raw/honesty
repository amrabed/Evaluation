Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "Truth leads to piety and piety leads to Jannah. A man persists in speaking the truth till he is recorded with Allah as a truthful man. Falsehood leads to transgression and transgression leads to the Hell-fire. A man continues to speak falsehood till he is recorded with Allah as a great liar" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (Peace be upon him) said, "Whosoever possesses these four characteristics, is a sheer hypocrite; and anyone who possesses one of them, possesses a characteristic of hypocrisy till he gives it up. (These are:) When he talks, he tells a lie; when he makes a covenant, he acts treacherously; and when he quarrels, he utters foul language" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

Abu Umamah Al-Bahili (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "I guarantee a house in Jannah for one who gives up arguing, even if he is in the right; and I guarantee a home in the middle of Jannah for one who abandons lying even for the sake of fun; and I guarantee a house in the highest part of Jannah for one who has good manners" [Abu Dawud]

Hakim bin Hizam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said: "Both parties in a business transaction have a right to annul it so long as they have not separated; and if they tell the truth and make everything clear to each other (i.e., the seller and the buyer speak the truth, the seller with regard to what is purchased, and the buyer with regard to the money) they will be blessed in their transaction, but if they conceal anything and lie, the blessing on their transaction will be eliminated" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (Peace be upon him) as saying: "The worst of lies is to pretend to have seen something which he has not seen.'' [Al-Bukhari].

Hasan bin `Ali (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I remember (these words) from Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him): "Give up what is doubtful to you for that which is not doubtful; for truth is peace of mind and falsehood is doubt" [At-Tirmidhi]
