Othman bin `Affan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) saying: "One who performs `Isha' prayer in congregation, is as if he has performed Salat for half of the night. And one who performs the Fajr prayer in congregation, is as if he has performed Salat the whole night" [Muslim]

Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said, "No Salat is more burdensome to the hypocrites than the Fajr (dawn) prayer and the `Isha' (night) prayer; and if they knew their merits, they would come to them even if they had to crawl to do so" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]
